# BalancedBinarySearchTreeProject

The project involves building a self-balancing binary search tree in C language. 
In computer science, a binary search tree is a hierarchal node-based data structure where each node has a key, a left value, and a right value. 
The binary search tree, as the name suggests, has two subtrees.
The left subtree consists of nodes with lesser keys, while the right subtree consists of nodes with greater keys. 
The AVL, the type of balanced binary search tree, is known for its search efficiency.

The main goal of a self-balancing binary search tree is to automatically minimize its height (which is the number of levels in the search tree) upon insertions and deletions. 
This way, the structure can self-balance and avoid reaching heights that are larger than they need to be.

The project will involve building a structure for binary trees from scratch.
Available functions will include insertions and deletions, a create function, an optimized search function, minimum and maximum functions, isLeft and isRight functions.
Hence, the required features of the project is to create a self-balancing binary search tree that can deal with insertions and deletions while maintaining minimal time complexity.
